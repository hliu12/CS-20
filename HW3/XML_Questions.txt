XML Questions

Case Study for XML:

Tufts University wants to manage its student's information including first name, last name, student ID and date of birth.
XML would be able to neatly hold this information using custom tags and the parent/child structure

I think XML is an ok way to hold data but it seems a little scary to have all the power
to name the data myself. I also like JSON a bit better as it seems more familiar to me
and seems to be more compatable with Javascript.
